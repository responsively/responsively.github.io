    <h2>what</h2>
    <p>
     <b>responsively.js</b> is a small, open-source JavaScript micro-library designed to help solve responsive design problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is designed to work well with sites that use client-side templates (handlebars.js, mustache, ...).  It is <i>not</i> intended to replace
     more traditional responsive design techniques (media queries, grids, ...) -- it should be used as a tool to solve specific responsive
     design problems that are not easily handled using traditional techniques alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     responsively.js commonly can be helpful in two situations:
     <ol>
      <li>
       <b>When content needs to be displayed differently based on the <i>content dimensions</i> rather than <i>device dimensions</i>.</b>
       <br>
       For example, content adjacent to abnormally large content might need to be displayed differently so that both pieces of content can still fit next to each other.
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>Continuous device sizes.</b>
       <br>
       Unlike media queries, which typically have specific resolution breakpoints, responsively.js will apply rules progressively when the content does not fit.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>usage</h2>

    <h3>modules</h3>
    <p>
     responsively.js supports AMD-style modules.  If not used as an AMD module, it will expose a <span class="js">responsively</span> variable on the global window object.
    </p>
    <h3><span class="js">responsively</span> and <span class="js">renderer</span> objects</h3>
    <p>
     <span class="js">responsively</span> is a singleton function object which is invoked with a single <i>options</i> parameter.  This returns a <span class="js">renderer</span> instance which has the following properties:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span class="js">render()</span>
       <br>
       This causes the <span class="js">renderer</span> to execute and process its rules.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="js">update()</span>
       <br>
       This updates the DOM that <span class="js">renderer</span> is managing in-place.  This is useful when a region of the screen needs to be dynamically updated and re-fit.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="js">level</span>
       <br>
       This returns the current level that the <span class="js">renderer</span> has rendered to.  This can be used to determine if something needs to be rendered in another way because it couldn't
       fit into this <span class="js">renderer</span>'s parent element.  For example, if you remove a "hints" object at level 2, and the <span class="renderer">renderer</span> is at level 2, you know that
       the "hints" object has been removed and might need to be displayed elsewhere on the page.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><span class="js">responsively</span> options</h3>
    <p>
     The <i>options</i> object has the following options:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span class="js">parent<sub>string (selector) or jQuery object</sub></span>
       <br>
       This is the root element that is to be rendered.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="js">constrain<sub>string (selector), <i>optional</i></sub></span>
       <br>
       Normally responsively.js attempts to constrain to the height and width of the parent element.  If <span class="js">constrain</span> is specified, it will constrain to the height and width of a
       element matched by the <span class="js">constrain</span> selector.  This selector is relative to <span class="js">parent</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="js">height<sub>integer (pixels), <i>optional</i></sub></span>
       <br>
       Responsively will keep applying levels until the height of the <span class="js">parent</span> (or <span class="js">constrain</span> element, if specified) is less than or equal to the
       specified height.  This option is useful if the <span class="js">parent</span> / <span class="js">constrain</span> element do not have a fixed height.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="js">inner<sub>string (html), <i>optional</i></sub></span>
       <br>
       The parent's inner HTML will be set to this string.  The string is typically the output of a template.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="js">outer<sub>string (html), <i>optional</i></sub></span>
       <br>
       The parent's outer HTML will be set to this string.  The string is typically the output of a template.  If the string is set to <span class="js">null</span>, then the outer element will
       be <i>removed</i> from the DOM.  If both <span class="js">inner</span> and <span class="js">outer</span> are both specified, <span class="js">outer</span> is applied first, then
       <span class="js">inner</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="js">rules</span>
       <br>
       This is an array which contains a list of rules to progressively apply.  Each rule is its own <i>options</i> object:
       <ul>
        <li>
         <span class="js">when<sub>boolean, <i>optional</i></span>
         <br>
         If this option is present and evalutes to false, this rule will be skipped.  Typically <span class="js">when</span> will be a function that returns a boolean.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="js">level<sub>integer (level), <i>optional</i></span>
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="js">a<sub>string (selector), <i>required by <span class="js">inner</span>, <span class="js">outer</span>, and <span class="js">hide</span></i></sub></span>
         <br>
         This sets the anchor for this rule to the specified selector.  This selector is relative to <span class="js">parent</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="js">fn<sub>function, <i>optional</i></span>
         <br>
         This function is simply evaluated whenever this rule triggers.  The return value is not used.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="js">inner<sub>string (html), <i>optional</i></sub></span>
         <br>
         The anchor's inner HTML will be set to this string.  The string is typically the output of a template.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="js">outer<sub>string (html), <i>optional</i></sub></span>
         <br>
          The parent's outer HTML will be set to this string.  The string is typically the output of a template.  If the string is set to <span class="js">null</span>, then the outer element will
          be <i>removed</i> from the DOM.  If both <span class="js">inner</span> and <span class="js">outer</span> are both specified, <span class="js">outer</span> is applied first, then
          <span class="js">inner</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="js">hide<sub>boolean, <i>optional</i></span>
         <br>
         The element <span class="js">a</span> will be hidden (<span class="js">display: none</span>).
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>Note:</i>  All options can also be functions.  If a function is found, it will be invoked and the return value of the function will be used as the final value.
    </p>
    <h3>how it works</h3>

    <p>
     responsively.js first renders the parent <span class="js">outer</span> and <span class="js">inner</span> properties (if present).  It then executes all level 0 rules in the
     <span class="js">rules</span> array.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the content does not fit, it will then keep moving up levels and applying rules at that level until the content fits or it runs out of levels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rules should be written to gradually remove and/or rewrite content so that the content will fit as size becomes more constrained (either due to smaller devices
     or larger content elements).
    </p>
    <p>
     This rendering is done effectively "desktop-first" because this ensures that the algorithm never needs to backtrack.  The rendering is done off-screen to increase performance and
     reduce screen flicker.  Possibly in the future render decisions can be cached to speed rendering further.
    </p>
    <p>
     Multiple <span class="js">renderer</span>s can be used on the same page to manage different elements.
    <p>
     <h3>dependencies</h3>
     responsively.js depends on jQuery 1.9 or later.
